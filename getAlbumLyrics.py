'''
Parameters: tuples: a list of tuples (x,y) with x being the album name and y the artist name
            genius: the genius object needed to access the Genius API
This function scrapes the lyrics for each song in each album in the tuples list
song names and release dates are also extracted 
for each song the info about artist, album name, song name, release date, and lyrics is saved in the data frame albumDf
album df is returned
