'''
Parameters: df: data frame, must have colums songname and artist
This function takes the names of songs and artists and assigns to each son the highest weighed LastFM tag, which is also in the list acceptedTags
a list with a tag for each song in the data frame df is returned
if there is no (matching) tag in LastFMs tags for the song, "noTag" is the placeholder
